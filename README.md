# Do-NT-a-Favor
An alternative Candy-Crush-like puzzle game with NT where elimination is not always desirable.

## DEPENDENCIES
* Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Kivy (https://kivy.org/#download)

## INSTALLATION
Download the entire repository. Drag and drop `main.py` onto `kivy-3.4.bat` inside the directory where Kivy is installed.

## INSTRUCTION
In the survival mode, your goal is to "feed" five NTs with a specific board element so they can climb up and reach the other side of the board in three minutes. The endless mode allows you to play the game without an end. There are 3 kinds of NTs with different diets, and you can switch them in the middle of a game.

Drag to switch two elements and align at least three elements horizontally or vertically. Special elements are created if more three elements are eliminated. For more details, see the story mode.

## VIDEO
You can watch the first demo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-AvX21im_s, but it contains some bugs that have been resolved by now.

## TODO
Make a standalone executable - or better yet, a mobile version. Some code for this purpose has actually been included, and it is exactly why I chose Kivy as the platform of development, but due to version conflict between Kivy and Python it was made harder.
